Howdy, I am Vinayaka Hegde, a computer science grad student at Texas A&M. Leveraging my three years of industry experience, I am passionate about building scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient systems. 

Previously, I worked at PES Labs, where I was involved in developing, deploying, and optimizing ML workloads on resource-constrained devices (such as accelerated edges, Nvidia Jetsons, etc), and my work culminated in two publications at top-tier venues.

Prior to that, I worked as a Software Developer in the Integrations team at Leadsquared, where I spearheaded API Development and Integrations.
