**Abstract:** Edge devices are typically used to perform lowlatency DNN inferencing close to the data source. However,with accelerated edge devices and privacy-oriented paradigms like Federated Learning, we can increasingly use them for DNN training too. This can require both training and inference workloads to be run concurrently on an edge device, without compromising on the inference latency. Here, we explore such concurrent scheduling on edge devices, and provide initial results demonstrating the interaction of training and inferencing on latency and throughput.
